# Internet of Things


## What is IOT
The "things" in Internet of things, or IoT, refer to machines or devices embedded with sensors that gather, store, and analyze information. When these things link to the Internet and a central data server, they can upload that data for further processing, and use it to make many tasks easier to perform.

When something is connected to the Internet, that means that it can send information or receive information, or both. This ability to send and receive information makes things "smart." This means that a thing doesn't need to have super storage or a super computer inside of it; it just has to connect to super storage or to a super computer.
 
 IoT-equipped devices include smart phones, laptops, and home and personal appliances such as coffee machines, refrigerators, Google Home, Apple watches, and Fitbits. These and many other everyday objects are increasingly becoming smart as they collect and exchange data over the Internet.  
 
 ## How does it work 
 **Connected Devices**
 
 An IoT system consists of sensors or devices that “talk” to the cloud through some kind of connectivity. The system then integrates data from the different devices and can apply analytics to share the most valuagable information with applications built to address specific needs.
